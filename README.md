Hi there. I'm Popper412. That's not my real name though. That's my username for a neat game I play called GeoFS. It's a flight sim in your web browser. 
Some "interesting" facts to say the least about me would be 1. I have no friends... 2. I play guitar (that's why I have no friends), 3. I love history. I have a fascination with planes. 
4. I wanna someday go into the U.S Navy. ETC... 
I live in the United States of America... "KNOCK KNOCK IT'S THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE HEARD YOU GOT OIL THAT ISN'T IN MY POSSESSION!" But that's where I live. Not sure what else 
you were expecting... My goal on being on Github is to entertain the people. I'm fluent in French "maybe not by the time you're reading this" but in a few years, i'll be fluent in French. 
I want to learn German and move to Germany. 'Why?' you ask. IDK. That's pretty much it.

I don't have any social media so ou can't reach out to me. Sorry. I have an E-mail but you're not getting it.
